A research implementation for semantic database query understanding and SQL generation using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 📚 Abstract

Translating natural language into SQL is critical for intuitive database access, yet open-source Small Language Models (SLMs) often struggle with complex schemas, limited context windows, and lower query accuracy. This paper introduces a two-phase workflow designed to enhance the Text-to-SQL capabilities of SLMs. The methodology first involves offline Database Schema Context Enrichment, where the schema is modeled as a graph, partitioned using Louvain community detection, and each cluster is enriched with metadata, relationships, and sample data. The second phase, SQL Generation and Self-Correction, occurs at query time, employing LLM-based table selection and an execution-driven feedback loop to iteratively refine the generated SQL query until successful execution. While involving multiple steps, evaluations on the Spider benchmark using Qwen2.5-Coder:14b and Phi-4:14b models demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness, achieving comparable or significantly improved Execution Accuracy (EX) over baseline performance, with Qwen reaching up to 83.8% EX on the test set despite running on consumer-grade hardware. Ablation studies confirmed the positive contributions of both enrichment and self-correction phases. The study concludes that this workflow provides a practical methodology for deploying resource-efficient open-source SLMs in Text-to-SQL applications, effectively mitigating common challenges. An open-source implementation is released to support further research.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Semantic Schema Enrichment**: Advanced analysis of database schemas to provide rich semantic descriptions of tables and columns
- **Natural Language to SQL Translation**: SQL generation and self-correction using LLMs
- **Baseline Comparison**: Comprehensive evaluation framework for comparing semantic enhancements
- **Docker-based Deployment**: Easy deployment with containerized services

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Embedding Service**: Handles helper functions for database utilities
2. **Engine Service**: Manages query processing and LLM interactions
3. **Ollama Service**: Provides LLM inference capabilities

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Docker and Docker Compose
- NVIDIA GPU (recommended)
- CUDA Toolkit (for GPU support)

### Database Setup

1. Download the required database files from our [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wc-k2cx8evGCcI7tvIejFbwxtRRWspO5?usp=sharing)
2. Extract the downloaded files into the `database` directory in the project root
3. For evaluation data, download the Spider dataset from [here](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider) and place it in `evaluation/spider_data/`
4. Ensure the database files are properly placed in the following structure:
   ```
   database/
   ├── schema.sql
   ├── data/
   │   └── [database files]
   └── README.md

   evaluation/
   └── spider_data/
       └── test_database/
           ├── baseball_1/
           ├── soccer_1/
           └── wta_1/
   ```

> **Note**: Large database files (>50MB) are not tracked in git. Please download them separately from the provided Google Drive link.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sequolkit.git
cd sequolkit

# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n sequolkit python=3.10 -y
conda activate sequolkit

OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:9292
EMBED_HOST_API=http://localhost:9191
SERVICE_PORT=5000
```

## 🔬 Research Components

### Schema Enrichment

Our schema enrichment component employs advanced LLM techniques to analyze and enhance database schemas with semantic descriptions, improving query understanding accuracy.

### SQL Agent Workflow

The SQL Agent implements a sophisticated natural language to SQL translation pipeline with semantic understanding capabilities.

### Baseline Workflow

A comprehensive evaluation framework for comparing the effectiveness of semantic enhancements against traditional approaches.

## 📊 Evaluation and Inference

### Evaluation Framework

SequolKit uses a comprehensive evaluation framework based on the Spider dataset methodology. The evaluation includes:

1. **Component Matching**: Evaluates individual SQL components (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.)
2. **Exact Matching**: Compares complete SQL queries for exact matches
3. **Execution Accuracy**: Tests query execution results against ground truth

### Running Evaluations

1. **Setup Evaluation Environment**:
   ```bash
   cd evaluation
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Prepare Test Data**:
   - Place your test queries in `evaluation/evaluation_examples/`
   - Ensure database files are in the correct location
   - Update `tables.json` with your schema information

3. **Run Evaluation**:
   ```bash
   python evaluation.py --gold [gold_file] --pred [predicted_file] --etype [evaluation_type] --db [database_dir] --table [table_file]
   ```

   Parameters:
   - `gold_file`: File containing ground truth SQL queries
   - `predicted_file`: Your model's predicted SQL queries
   - `evaluation_type`: "match" for exact matching, "exec" for execution accuracy, or "all" for both
   - `database_dir`: Directory containing SQLite databases
   - `table_file`: JSON file with database schema information

### Inference Process

1. **Model Inference**:
   ```bash
   python inferences_testing.py --input [input_file] --output [output_file] --model [model_name]
   ```

2. **Output Format**:
   - Each prediction should be a valid SQL query
   - Include database ID with each prediction
   - Follow the format: `[SQL_QUERY]\t[DB_ID]`

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Exact Match Accuracy
   - Component-wise Accuracy
   - Execution Accuracy
   - Hardness-based Analysis

### Best Practices

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize table and column names
   - Handle special characters and SQL keywords
   - Validate query syntax before evaluation

2. **Evaluation**:
   - Use both exact matching and execution accuracy
   - Consider query complexity in analysis
   - Document any special cases or limitations

3. **Results Analysis**:
   - Analyze performance by query complexity
   - Track component-wise accuracy
   - Compare against baseline models

For detailed evaluation metrics and examples, refer to the [evaluation documentation](evaluation/README.md).
